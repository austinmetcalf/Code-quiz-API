# Code Quiz API

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a timed quiz with coding questions.  If questions are answered correctly, the quiz will advance.  If questions are not answered correctly, time is deducted, and you must try again.  The quiz is directed to the end page when timer reaches zero or all questions are answered, whichever comes first.  You may then enter your initials and the score page will pull that information from local storage.  In its entirety there are several pages of HTML, CSS, and JS assembled by me.  Several snippets of code, however, were borrowed from W3schools and stack overflow.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, Javascript.
